    "**Q1.** *Mergesort:* Modify your `mergesort(array)` function that you did in your cohort session to take one additional argument called `byfunc`, i.e. `mergesort(array, byfunc)`. If the caller does not specify the value of `byfunc`, its default value is `None`. When this argument is `None`, the function `mergesort` behaves similar to your cohort session by sorting the array according to its values. However, when the value of this argument is not `None` but rather some other function, your `mergesort` function should sort the array according to the value returned by this function. \n",
